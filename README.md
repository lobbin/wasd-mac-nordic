# wasd-mac-nordic
## This is a WASD custom keyboard layout for Mac computers for the nordic
## countries.

Based on the the SVG original from WASD Keyboards and influenced from
https://github.com/jasonbraun/WASD-Mac-Layout/

I just made some small tweaks to the layout, centering, sizing of icons and
changed the main font being used.

I know the title of the project says nordic, but at the moment, it's Swedish
only, but should be easy enough to change.

I still haven't placed an order, so there might be issues related to the file
that I'm unaware of.

### How To
1. Download the .svg file from this repository.
2. Modify it to fit your needs, tutorial can be found [here](
https://support.wasdkeyboards.com/hc/en-us/sections/115002234888-SVG-Layout-Tutorials)
3. Go to your WASD and create a keycap set or custom keyboard based on the .svg
file. Use WASD Keyboard as an example, just go to [this page](
http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard.html) and
upload your .ai file.
4. You need to map the keys to the labeled functions. Use
[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) for that.
